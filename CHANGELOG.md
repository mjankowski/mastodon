- Add reminder when about to post without alt text in web UI (#33760 and #33784 by @Gargron)
- Add a warning in Web UI when composing a post when the selected and detected language are different (#33042, #33683, #33700, #33724, #33770, and #34193 by @ClearlyClaire and @Gargron)
- Add support for verifying and displaying remote quote posts (#34370, #34481, #34510, #34551, #34480, #34479, #34553, #34584, #34623, #34738, #34766, #34770, #34772, #34773, #34786, #34790, #34864, #34957, #34961, #35016, #35022, #35036, #34946, #34945 and #34958 by @ClearlyClaire and @diondiondion)\
  Support for verifying remote quotes according to [FEP-044f](https://codeberg.org/fediverse/fep/src/branch/main/fep/044f/fep-044f.md) and displaying them in the Web UI has been implemented.\
  Quoting other people is not implemented yet, and it is currently not possible to mark your own posts as allowing quotes. However, a new “Who can quote” setting has been added to the “Posting defaults” section of the user settings. This setting allows you to set a default that will be used for new posts made on Mastodon 4.5 and newer, when quote posts will be fully implemented.\
  In the REST API, quote posts are represented by a new `quote` attribute on `Status` and `StatusEdit` entities: https://docs.joinmastodon.org/entities/StatusEdit/#quote https://docs.joinmastodon.org/entities/Status/#quote
- Add ability to reorder and translate server rules (#34637, #34737, #34494, #34756, #34820, #34997, #35170, #35174 and #35174 by @ChaosExAnima and @ClearlyClaire)\
  Rules are now shown in the user’s language, if a translation has been set.\
  In the REST API, `Rule` entities now have a new `translations` attribute: https://docs.joinmastodon.org/entities/Rule/#translations
- Add emoji from Twemoji 15.1.0, including in the emoji picker/completion (#33395, #34321, #34620, and #34677 by @ChaosExAnima, @ClearlyClaire, @TheEssem, and @eramdam)
- Add option to remove account from followers in web UI (#34488 by @Gargron)
- Add relationship tags to profiles and hover cards in web UI (#34467 and #34792 by @Gargron and @diondiondion)
- Add ability to open posts in a new tab by middle-clicking in web UI (#32988, #33106, #33419, and #34700 by @ClearlyClaire, @Gargron, and @tribela)
- Add new filter action to blur media (#34256 by @ClearlyClaire)\
  In the REST API, this adds a new possible value of `blur` to the `filter_action` attribute: https://docs.joinmastodon.org/entities/Filter/#filter_action
- Add dropdown menu to hashtag links in web UI (#34393 by @Gargron)
- **Add server setting to allow referrer** (#33214, #33239, #33903, and #34731 by @ChaosExAnima, @ClearlyClaire, @Gargron, and @renchap)\
  In order to protect the privacy of users of small or thematic servers, Mastodon previously avoided transmitting referrer information when clicking outside links, which unfortunately made Mastodon completely invisible to other websites, even though the privacy implications on large generic servers are very limited.\
  Server administrators can now chose to opt in to transmit referrer information when following an external link. Only the domain name is transmitted, not the referrer path.
- Add double tap to zoom and swipe to dismiss to media modal in web UI (#34210 by @Gargron)
- Add link from Web UI for Hashtags to the Moderation UI (#31448 by @ThisIsMissEm)
- **Add terms of service** (#33055, #33233, #33230, #33703, #33699, #33994, #33993, #34105, #34122, #34200, #34527, #35053, #35115, #35126, #35127 and #35233 by @ClearlyClaire, @Gargron, @mjankowski, and @oneiros)\
  Server administrators can now fill in Terms of Service and notify their users of upcoming changes.
- Add optional bulk mailer settings (#35191 and #35203 by @oneiros)\
  This adds the optional environment variables `BULK_SMTP_PORT`, `BULK_SMTP_SERVER`, `BULK_SMTP_LOGIN` and so on analogous to `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_SERVER`, `SMTP_LOGIN` and related SMTP configuration environment variables.\
  When `BULK_SMTP_SERVER` is set, this group of variables is used instead of the regular ones for sending announcement notification emails and Terms of Service notification emails.
- **Add age verification on sign-up** (#34150, #34663, and #34636 by @ClearlyClaire and @Gargron)\
  Server administrators now have a setting to set a minimum age requirement for creating a new server, asking users for their date of birth. The date of birth is checked against the minimum age requirement server-side but not stored.\
  The following REST API changes have been made to accommodate this:
  - `registrations.min_age` has been added to the `Instance` entity: https://docs.joinmastodon.org/entities/Instance/#registrations-min_age
  - the `date_of_birth` parameter has been added to the account creation API: https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/accounts/#create
- Add ability to dismiss alt text badge by tapping it in web UI (#33737 by @Gargron)
- Add loading indicator to timeline gap indicators in web UI (#33762 by @Gargron)
- Add interaction modal when trying to interact with a poll while logged out (#32609 by @ThisIsMissEm)
- **Add experimental FASP support** (#34031, #34415, #34765, #34965, #34964, #34033, #35218, #35262 and #35263 by @oneiros)\
  This is a first step towards supporting “Fediverse Auxiliary Service Providers” (https://github.com/mastodon/fediverse_auxiliary_service_provider_specifications). This is mostly interesting to developers who would like to implement their own FASP, but also includes the capability to share data with a discovery provider (see https://www.fediscovery.org).
- Add ability for admins to send announcements to all users via email (#33928 and #34411 by @ClearlyClaire)\
  This is meant for critical announcements only, as this will potentially send a lot of emails and cannot be opted out of by users.
- Add Server Moderation Notes (#31529 by @ThisIsMissEm)
- Add loading spinner to “Post” button when sending a post (#35153 by @diondiondion)
- Add option to use system scrollbar styling (#32117 by @vmstan)

- Add `t` hotkey for post translations (#33441 by @ClearlyClaire)
- Add timestamp to all announcements in Web UI (#18329 by @ClearlyClaire)
- Add dropdown menu with quick actions to lists of accounts in web UI (#34391, #34709, and #34767 by @Gargron, @diondiondion, and @mkljczk)
- Add support for displaying “year in review” notification in web UI (#32710, #32765, #32709, #32807, #32914, #33148, and #33882 by @Gargron and @mjankowski)\
  Note that the notification is currently not generated automatically, and at the moment requires a manual undocumented administrator action.
- Add experimental support for receiving HTTP Message Signatures (RFC9421) (#34814, #35033, #35109 and #35278 by @oneiros)\
  For now, this needs to be explicitly enabled through the `http_message_signatures` feature flag (`EXPERIMENTAL_FEATURES=http_message_signatures`). This currently only covers verifying such signatures (inbound HTTP requests), not issuing them (outbound HTTP requests).
- Add experimental Async Refreshes API (#34918 by @oneiros)
- Add experimental server-side feature to fetch remote replies (#32615, #34147, #34149, #34151, #34615, #34682, and #34702 by @ClearlyClaire and @sneakers-the-rat)\
  This experimental feature causes the server to recursively fetch replies in background tasks whenever a user opens a remote post. This happens asynchronously and the client is currently not notified of the existence of new replies, which will thus only be displayed the next time this post’s context gets requested.\
  This feature needs to be explicitly enabled server-side by setting `FETCH_REPLIES_ENABLED` environment variable to `true`.
- Add simple feature flag system through the `EXPERIMENTAL_FEATURES` environment variable (#34038 and #34124 by @oneiros)\
  This allows enabling comma-separated feature flags for experimental features.\
  The current supported feature flags are `inbound_quotes`, `fasp` and `http_message_signatures`.

- Add warning for Elasticsearch index analyzers mismatch (#34515 and #34567 by @ClearlyClaire and @Gargron)

- Add `-skip-filled-timeline` option to `tootctl feed build` to skip half-filled feeds (#33844 by @ClearlyClaire)
- Add support for changing the base Docker registry with the `BASE_REGISTRY` `ARG` (#33712 by @wolfspyre)
- Add an optional metric exporter (#33734, #33840, #34172, #34192, #34223, and #35005 by @oneiros and @renchap)\
  Optionally enable the `prometheus_exporter` ruby gem (see https://github.com/discourse/prometheus_exporter) to collect and expose metrics. See the documentation for all the details: https://docs.joinmastodon.org/admin/config/#prometheus
- Add `attribution_domains` attribute to `PATCH /api/v1/accounts/update_credentials` (#32730 by @c960657)\
  This is documented at https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/accounts/#update_credentials

- Add the standard VCS attributes to OpenTelemetry spans (#32904 by @renchap)
- Add endpoint to remove web push subscription (#32626 by @oneiros)\
  Mastodon now sets a new `Unsubscribe-URL` request header when performing WebPush requests. This URL can be used by the WebPush server to disable the WebPush subscription on Mastodon’s side in case of unfixable errors.
- Add missing content warning text to RSS feeds (#32406 by @mjankowski)
- Add Swiss German to languages dropdown (#29281 by @FlohEinstein)

  Getting the embed code is only reliable for local posts.\
  It never worked for non-Mastodon servers, and stopped working correctly with the changes made in 4.3.0.\
  We have therefore decided to remove the menu entry while we investigate solutions.

## [4.3.0] - 2024-10-08

The following changelog entries focus on changes visible to users, administrators, client developers or federated software developers, but there has also been a lot of code modernization, refactoring, and tooling work, in particular by @mjankowski.

### Security

- **Add confirmation interstitial instead of silently redirecting logged-out visitors to remote resources** (#27792, #28902, and #30651 by @ClearlyClaire and @Gargron)\
  This fixes a longstanding open redirect in Mastodon, at the cost of added friction when local links to remote resources are shared.
- Fix ReDoS vulnerability on some Ruby versions ([GHSA-jpxp-r43f-rhvx](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/security/advisories/GHSA-jpxp-r43f-rhvx))
- Change `form-action` Content-Security-Policy directive to be more restrictive (#26897 and #32241 by @ClearlyClaire)
- Update dependencies

### Added

- **Add server-side notification grouping** (#29889, #30576, #30685, #30688, #30707, #30776, #30779, #30781, #30440, #31062, #31098, #31076, #31111, #31123, #31223, #31214, #31224, #31299, #31325, #31347, #31304, #31326, #31384, #31403, #31433, #31509, #31486, #31513, #31592, #31594, #31638, #31746, #31652, #31709, #31725, #31745, #31613, #31657, #31840, #31610, #31929, #32089, #32085, #32243, #32179 and #32254 by @ClearlyClaire, @Gargron, @mgmn, and @renchap)\
  Group notifications of the same type for the same target, so that your notifications no longer get cluttered by boost and favorite notifications as soon as a couple of your posts get traction.\
  This is done server-side so that clients can efficiently get relevant groups without having to go through numerous pages of individual notifications.\
  As part of this, the visual design of the entire notifications feature has been revamped.\
  This feature is intended to eventually replace the existing notifications column, but for this first beta, users will have to enable it in the “Experimental features” section of the notifications column settings.\
  The API is not final yet, but it consists of:
  - a new `group_key` attribute to `Notification` entities
  - `GET /api/v2/notifications`: https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/grouped_notifications/#get-grouped
  - `GET /api/v2/notifications/:group_key`: https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/grouped_notifications/#get-notification-group
  - `GET /api/v2/notifications/:group_key/accounts`: https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/grouped_notifications/#get-group-accounts
  - `POST /api/v2/notifications/:group_key/dismiss`: https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/grouped_notifications/#dismiss-group
  - `GET /api/v2/notifications/:unread_count`: https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/grouped_notifications/#unread-group-count
- **Add notification policies, filtered notifications and notification requests** (#29366, #29529, #29433, #29565, #29567, #29572, #29575, #29588, #29646, #29652, #29658, #29666, #29693, #29699, #29737, #29706, #29570, #29752, #29810, #29826, #30114, #30251, #30559, #29868, #31008, #31011, #30996, #31149, #31220, #31222, #31225, #31242, #31262, #31250, #31273, #31310, #31316, #31322, #31329, #31324, #31331, #31343, #31342, #31309, #31358, #31378, #31406, #31256, #31456, #31419, #31457, #31508, #31540, #31541, #31723, #32062 and #32281 by @ClearlyClaire, @Gargron, @TheEssem, @mgmn, @oneiros, and @renchap)\
  The old “Block notifications from non-followers”, “Block notifications from people you don't follow” and “Block direct messages from people you don't follow” notification settings have been replaced by a new set of settings found directly in the notification column.\
  You can now separately filter or drop notifications from people you don't follow, people who don't follow you, accounts created within the past 30 days, as well as unsolicited private mentions, and accounts limited by the moderation.\
  Instead of being outright dropped, notifications that you chose to filter are put in a separate “Filtered notifications” box that you can review separately without it clogging your main notifications.\
  This adds the following REST API endpoints:
  - `GET /api/v2/notifications/policy`: https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/notifications/#get-policy
  - `PATCH /api/v2/notifications/policy`: https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/notifications/#update-the-filtering-policy-for-notifications
  - `GET /api/v1/notifications/requests`: https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/notifications/#get-requests
  - `GET /api/v1/notifications/requests/:id`: https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/notifications/#get-one-request
  - `POST /api/v1/notifications/requests/:id/accept`: https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/notifications/#accept-request
  - `POST /api/v1/notifications/requests/:id/dismiss`: https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/notifications/#dismiss-request
  - `POST /api/v1/notifications/requests/accept`: https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/notifications/#accept-multiple-requests
  - `POST /api/v1/notifications/requests/dismiss`: https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/notifications/#dismiss-multiple-requests
  - `GET /api/v1/notifications/requests/merged`: https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/notifications/#requests-merged

  In addition, accepting one or more notification requests generates a new streaming event:
  - `notifications_merged`: an event of this type indicates accepted notification requests have finished merging, and the notifications list should be refreshed

- **Add notifications of severed relationships** (#27511, #29665, #29668, #29670, #29700, #29714, #29712, and #29731 by @ClearlyClaire and @Gargron)\
  Notify local users when they lose relationships as a result of a local moderator blocking a remote account or server, allowing the affected user to retrieve the list of broken relationships.\
  Note that this does not notify remote users.\
  This adds the `severed_relationships` notification type to the REST API and streaming, with a new [`event` attribute](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/entities/Notification/#relationship_severance_event).
- **Add hover cards in web UI** (#30754, #30864, #30850, #30879, #30928, #30949, #30948, #30931, and #31300 by @ClearlyClaire, @Gargron, and @renchap)\
  Hovering over an avatar or username will now display a hover card with the first two lines of the user's description and their first two profile fields.\
  This can be disabled in the “Animations and accessibility” section of the preferences.
- **Add "system" theme setting (light/dark theme depending on user system preference)** (#29748, #29553, #29795, #29918, #30839, and #30861 by @nshki, @ErikUden, @mjankowski, @renchap, and @vmstan)\
  Add a “system” theme that automatically switch between default dark and light themes depending on the user's system preferences.\
  Also changes the default server theme to this new “system” theme so that automatic theme selection happens even when logged out.
- **Add timeline of public posts about a trending link** (#30381 and #30840 by @Gargron)\
  You can now see public posts mentioning currently-trending articles from people who have opted into discovery features.\
  This adds a new REST API endpoint: https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/timelines/#link
- **Add author highlight for news articles whose authors are on the fediverse** (#30398, #30670, #30521, #30846, #31819, #31900 and #32188 by @Gargron, @mjankowski and @oneiros)\
  This adds a mechanism to [highlight the author of news articles](https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2024/07/highlighting-journalism-on-mastodon/) shared on Mastodon.\
  Articles hosted outside the fediverse can indicate a fediverse author with a meta tag:
  ```html
  <meta name="fediverse:creator" content="username@domain" />
  ```
  On the API side, this is represented by a new `authors` attribute to the `PreviewCard` entity: https://docs.joinmastodon.org/entities/PreviewCard/#authors \
  Users can allow arbitrary domains to use `fediverse:creator` to credit them by visiting `/settings/verification`.\
  This is federated as a new `attributionDomains` property in the `http://joinmastodon.org/ns` namespace, containing an array of domain names: https://docs.joinmastodon.org/spec/activitypub/#properties-used-1
- **Add in-app notifications for moderation actions and warnings** (#30065, #30082, and #30081 by @ClearlyClaire)\
  In addition to email notifications, also notify users of moderation actions or warnings against them directly within the app, so they are less likely to miss important communication from their moderators.\
  This adds the `moderation_warning` notification type to the REST API and streaming, with a new [`moderation_warning` attribute](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/entities/Notification/#moderation_warning).
- **Add domain information to profiles in web UI** (#29602 by @Gargron)\
  Clicking the domain of a user in their profile will now open a tooltip with a short explanation about servers and federation.
- **Add support for Redis sentinel** (#31694, #31623, #31744, #31767, and #31768 by @ThisIsMissEm and @oneiros)\
  See https://docs.joinmastodon.org/admin/scaling/#redis-sentinel
- **Add ability to reorder uploaded media before posting in web UI** (#28456 and #32093 by @Gargron)

- Add ability to view alt text by clicking the ALT badge in web UI (#32058 by @Gargron)

- Add reblogs and favourites counts to statuses in ActivityPub (#32007 by @Gargron)

- Add ability for admins to configure instance favicon and logo (#30040, #30208, #30259, #30375, #30734, #31016, and #30205 by @ClearlyClaire, @FawazFarid, @JasonPunyon, @mgmn, and @renchap)\
  This is also exposed through the REST API: https://docs.joinmastodon.org/entities/Instance/#icon
- Add `api_versions` to `/api/v2/instance` (#31354 by @ClearlyClaire)\
  Add API version number to make it easier for clients to detect compatible features going forward.\
  See API documentation at https://docs.joinmastodon.org/entities/Instance/#api-versions
- Add quick links to Administration and Moderation Reports from Web UI (#24838 by @ThisIsMissEm)
- Add link to `/admin/roles` in moderation interface when changing someone's role (#31791 by @ClearlyClaire)
- Add recent audit log entries in federation moderation interface (#27386 by @ThisIsMissEm)
- Add profile setup to onboarding in web UI (#27829, #27876, and #28453 by @Gargron)
- Add prominent share/copy button on profiles in web UI (#27865 and #27889 by @ClearlyClaire and @Gargron)
- Add optional hints for server rules (#29539 and #29758 by @ClearlyClaire and @Gargron)\
  Server rules can now be broken into a short rule name and a longer explanation of the rule.\
  This adds a new [`hint` attribute](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/entities/Rule/#hint) to `Rule` entities in the REST API.

- Add `MASTODON_SIDEKIQ_READY_FILENAME` environment variable to use a file for Sidekiq to signal it is ready to process jobs (#30971 and #30988 by @renchap)\
  In the official Docker image, this is set to `sidekiq_process_has_started_and_will_begin_processing_jobs` so that Sidekiq will touch `tmp/sidekiq_process_has_started_and_will_begin_processing_jobs` to signal readiness.
- Add `S3_RETRY_LIMIT` environment variable to make S3 retries configurable (#23215 by @smiba)

  Server admins can now use libvips as a faster and lighter alternative to ImageMagick for processing user-uploaded images.\
  This requires libvips 8.13 or newer, and needs to be enabled with `MASTODON_USE_LIBVIPS=true`.\
  This is enabled by default in the official Docker images, and is intended to completely replace ImageMagick in the future.

- Add support for specifying custom CA cert for Elasticsearch through `ES_CA_FILE` (#29122 and #29147 by @ClearlyClaire)
- Add groundwork for annual reports for accounts (#28693 by @Gargron)\
  This lays the groundwork for a “year-in-review”/“wrapped” style report for local users, but is currently not in use.
- Add notification email on invalid second authenticator (#28822 by @ClearlyClaire)
- Add date of account deletion in list of accounts in the admin interface (#25640 by @tribela)
- Add new emojis from `jdecked/twemoji` 15.0 (#28404 by @TheEssem)
- Add configurable error handling in attachment batch deletion (#28184 by @vmstan)\
  This makes the S3 batch size configurable through the `S3_BATCH_DELETE_LIMIT` environment variable (defaults to 1000), and adds some retry logic, configurable through the `S3_BATCH_DELETE_RETRY` environment variable (defaults to 3).
- Add VAPID public key to instance serializer (#28006 by @ThisIsMissEm)
- Add support for serving JRD `/.well-known/host-meta.json` in addition to XRD host-meta (#32206 by @c960657)

### Changed

- **Change icons throughout the web interface** (#27385, #27539, #27555, #27579, #27700, #27817, #28519, #28709, #28064, #28775, #28780, #27924, #29294, #29395, #29537, #29569, #29610, #29612, #29649, #29844, #27780, #30974, #30963, #30962, #30961, #31362, #31363, #31359, #31371, #31360, #31512, #31511, #31525, #32153, and #32201 by @ClearlyClaire, @Gargron, @arbolitoloco1, @mjankowski, @nclm, @renchap, @ronilaukkarinen, and @zunda)\
  This changes all the interface icons from FontAwesome to Material Symbols for a more modern look, consistent with the official Mastodon Android app.\
  In addition, better care is given to pixel alignment, and icon variants are used to better highlight active/inactive state.
- **Change design of compose form in web UI** (#28119, #29059, #29248, #29372, #29384, #29417, #29456, #29406, #29651, #29659, #31889 and #32033 by @ClearlyClaire, @Gargron, @eai04191, @hinaloe, and @ronilaukkarinen)\
  The compose form has been completely redesigned for a more modern and consistent look, as well as spelling out the chosen privacy setting and language name at all times.\
  As part of this, the “Unlisted” privacy setting has been renamed to “Quiet public”.
- **Change design of modals in the web UI** (#29576, #29614, #29640, #29644, #30131, #30884, #31399, #31555, #31752, #31801, #31883, #31844, #31864, and #31943 by @ClearlyClaire, @Gargron, @tribela and @vmstan)\
  The mute, block, and domain block confirmation modals have been completely redesigned to be clearer and include more detailed information on the action to be performed.\
  They also have a more modern and consistent design, along with other confirmation modals in the application.
- **Change colors throughout the web UI** (#29522, #29584, #29653, #29779, #29803, #29809, #29808, #29828, #31034, #31168, #31266, #31348, #31349, #31361, #31510 and #32128 by @ClearlyClaire, @Gargron, @mjankowski, @renchap, and @vmstan)
- **Change onboarding prompt to follow suggestions carousel in web UI** (#28878, #29272, and #31912 by @Gargron)
- **Change email templates** (#28416, #28755, #28814, #29064, #28883, #29470, #29607, #29761, #29760, #29879, #32073 and #32132 by @c960657, @ClearlyClaire, @Gargron, @hteumeuleu, and @mjankowski)\
  All emails to end-users have been completely redesigned with a fresh new look, providing more information while making them easier to read and keeping maximum compatibility across mail clients.
- **Change follow recommendations algorithm** (#28314, #28433, #29017, #29108, #29306, #29550, #29619, and #31474 by @ClearlyClaire, @Gargron, @kernal053, @mjankowski, and @wheatear-dev)\
  This replaces the “past interactions” recommendation algorithm with a “friends of friends” algorithm that suggests accounts followed by people you follow, and a “similar profiles” algorithm that suggests accounts with a profile similar to your most recent follows.\
  In addition, the implementation has been significantly reworked, and all follow recommendations are now dismissable.\
  This change deprecates the `source` attribute in `Suggestion` entities in the REST API, and replaces it with the new [`sources` attribute](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/entities/Suggestion/#sources).
- Change account search algorithm (#30803 by @Gargron)
- **Change streaming server to use its own dependencies and its own docker image** (#24702, #27967, #26850, #28112, #28115, #28137, #28138, #28497, #28548, #30795, #31612, and #31615 by @TheEssem, @ThisIsMissEm, @jippi, @renchap, @timetinytim, and @vmstan)\
  In order to reduce the amount of runtime dependencies, the streaming server has been moved into a separate package and Docker image.\
  The `mastodon` image does not contain the streaming server anymore, as it has been moved to its own `mastodon-streaming` image.\
  Administrators may need to update their setup accordingly.

- Change order of the "muting" and "blocking" list options in “Data Exports” (#26088 by @fixermark)
- Change admin and moderation notes character limit from 500 to 2000 characters (#30288 by @ThisIsMissEm)
- Change mute options to be in dropdown on muted users list in web UI (#30049 and #31315 by @ClearlyClaire and @Gargron)
- Change out-of-band hashtags design in web UI (#29732 by @Gargron)

- Change border of active compose field search inputs (#29832 and #29839 by @vmstan)
- Change instances of Nokogiri HTML4 parsing to HTML5 (#31812, #31815, #31813, and #31814 by @flavorjones)
- Change link detection to allow `@` at the end of an URL (#31124 by @adamniedzielski)
- Change User-Agent to use Mastodon as the product, and http.rb as platform details (#31192 by @ClearlyClaire)

- Change unconfirmed users to be kept for one week instead of two days (#30285 by @renchap)
- Change maximum page size for Admin Domain Management APIs from 200 to 500 (#31253 by @ThisIsMissEm)
- Change database pool size to default to Sidekiq concurrency settings in Sidekiq processes (#26488 by @sinoru)
- Change alt text to empty string for avatars (#21875 by @jasminjohal)
- Change Docker images to use custom-built libvips and ffmpeg (#30571, #30569, and #31498 by @vmstan)
- Change external links in the admin audit log to plain text or local administration pages (#27139 and #27150 by @ClearlyClaire and @ThisIsMissEm)
- Change YJIT to be enabled when available (#30310 and #27283 by @ClearlyClaire and @mjankowski)\
  Enable Ruby's built-in just-in-time compiler. This improves performances substantially, at the cost of a slightly increased memory usage.
- Change `.env` file loading from deprecated `dotenv-rails` gem to `dotenv` gem (#29173 and #30121 by @mjankowski)\
  This should have no effect except in the unlikely case an environment variable included a newline.
- Change “Panjabi” language name to the more common spelling “Punjabi” (#27117 by @gunchleoc)
- Change encryption of OTP secrets to use ActiveRecord Encryption (#29831, #28325, #30151, #30202, #30340, and #30344 by @ClearlyClaire and @mjankowski)\
  This requires a manual step from administrators of existing servers. Indeed, they need to generate new secrets, which can be done using `bundle exec rails db:encryption:init`.\
  Furthermore, there is a risk that the introduced migration fails if the server was misconfigured in the past. If that happens, the migration error will include the relevant information.
- Change `/api/v1/announcements` to return regular `Status` entities (#26736 by @ClearlyClaire)
- Change imports to convert case-insensitive fields to lowercase (#29739 and #29740 by @ThisIsMissEm)
- Change stats in the admin interface to be inclusive of the full selected range, from beginning of day to end of day (#29416 and #29841 by @mjankowski)
- Change materialized views to be refreshed concurrently to avoid locks (#29015 by @Gargron)
- Change compose form to use server-provided post character and poll options limits (#28928 and #29490 by @ClearlyClaire and @renchap)
- Change streaming server logging from `npmlog` to `pino` and `pino-http` (#27828 by @ThisIsMissEm)\
  This changes the Mastodon streaming server log format, so this might be considered a breaking change if you were parsing the logs.
- Change media “ALT” label to use a specific CSS class (#28777 by @ClearlyClaire)
- Change streaming API host to not be overridden to localhost in development mode (#28557 by @ClearlyClaire)
- Change cookie rotator to use SHA1 digest for new cookies (#27392 by @ClearlyClaire)\
  Note that this requires that no pre-4.2.0 Mastodon web server is running when this code is deployed, as those would not understand the new cookies.\
  Therefore, zero-downtime updates are only supported if you're coming from 4.2.0 or newer. If you want to skip Mastodon 4.2, you will need to completely stop Mastodon services before updating.
- Change preview card deletes to be done using batch method (#28183 by @vmstan)
- Change `img-src` and `media-src` CSP directives to not include `https:` (#28025 and #28561 by @ClearlyClaire)
- Change self-destruct procedure (#26439, #29049, and #29420 by @ClearlyClaire and @zunda)\
  Instead of enqueuing deletion jobs immediately, `tootctl self-destruct` now outputs a value for the `SELF_DESTRUCT` environment variable, which puts a server in self-destruct mode, processing deletions in the background, while giving users access to their export archives.

### Removed

- Remove unused E2EE messaging code and related `crypto` OAuth scope (#31193, #31945, #31963, and #31964 by @ClearlyClaire and @mjankowski)
- Remove StatsD integration (replaced by OpenTelemetry) (#30240 by @mjankowski)
- Remove `CacheBuster` default options (#30718 by @mjankowski)
- Remove home marker updates from the Web UI (#22721 by @davbeck)\
  The web interface was unconditionally updating the home marker to the most recent received post, discarding any value set by other clients, thus making the feature unreliable.
- Remove support for Ruby 3.0 (reaching EOL) (#29702 by @mjankowski)
- Remove setting for unfollow confirmation modal (#29373 by @ClearlyClaire)\
  Instead, the unfollow confirmation modal will always be displayed.
- Remove support for Capistrano (#27295 and #30009 by @mjankowski and @renchap)
